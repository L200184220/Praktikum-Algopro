>>> Name = "Motwkel mhmoud mohmed Adam "
>>> ##this command put string "Motwkel mhmoud Mohmed" to the funcion of name,if we call it .
>>> Name
'Motwkel mhmoud mohmed Adam '
>>> NIM = "L200184220"
>>> ##this command put string "L200184220" to the functino of NIM . so the python will print "L200184220" if we call function of NIM .
>>> NIM
'L200184220'
>>> X = "1" +NIM[7:]
>>> ##this command add a slice of NIM data (from 7th character until the end string) and to combination with "1".
>>> X
'1220'
>>> a = int(X)
>>> ##this command to change atype of NIM, from type is string to type integer.
>>> a
1220
>>> b = len (Name)
>>> ##this command to know many a character of Name.
>>> b
27
>>> type(a)
<class 'int'>
>>> 
>>> ##this command to know what is the type of function a .
>>> type (b)
<class 'int'>
>>> ##this command to know what is the type of function .
>>> ##this command to know what is the type of function b .
>>> a//b
45
>>> ##this command to change value of divide value of b , from float to integer
>>> 10*(a-99)
11210
>>> ##this command subtract value of a-99, and then multiply 10 .
>>> b**2
729
>>> ##this command to the power of two from value of function b .
>>> a%b
5
>>> ##this command give result after dividing the value of a and b .and count the divide remainder.
>>> c = 12.5
>>> type(c)
<class 'float'>
>>> ##this command to know what is the type of function c .
>>> a/c
97.6
>>> ##this command to make value of a divide value
>>> ##this command to make value of a divide value of c .
>>> a//c
97.0
>>> ##this command to change value of a divide value of b to simplify .
>>> a%c
7.5
>>> ##this command give result after dividing the value of a and b . and count the divide remainder .
>>> a>b
True
>>> ##this comand is a bigger then b.so the python print true .
>>> type(a > b)
<class 'bool'>
>>> ##this command for take decision . and the decision is print true and false.
>>> a > b and b
27
>>> a > b and b > c
True
>>> ##this command stated that point a is more bigger point from b , and point b is more bigger from c .
>>> a > 140 or b < 20
True
>>> ## this command stated that point a is more biggest from 140, because point a is 1220.or b is smaller from 20 .
